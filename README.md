# UI Blueprint Editor

A plugin for Frosty editor. 
It will let you view/edit "UIWidgetBlueprint" assets. To use it, go to a UIWidgetBlueprint and click the 
edit button in the top right, this button will switch views between the normal editor and the ui editor. You can 
also hide a UI element by right clicking and unhide by clicking the unhide button at the top. This plugin doesn't 
support UIs with "Lists" or "Rows" so if you see a UI blueprint that seems invisible that is probably why.

**This plugin will only work with PvZ GW2!** You can test it with other games but I'm pretty sure it won't work, 
if you want you can edit the source to make it work for other games.

## Update log

v1.1.0.2

- Fixed a single line of code which messed up the anchors for widget references.

v1.1.0.1:

- Re-added the "Use Anchor" option. Having this enabled will make the UI positioning use Anchor instead of Offset, which is better since Anchor will put any UI element at the same position on the screen no matter what size the screen is. You can find this at "Tools > Options > UI Editor Options" 

v1.1.0.0:

- Arrow key/WASD movement for precise movements
- A zooming/panning feature!
- Visible hitboxes when hovering over UI elements
- Textures are no longer written to your temp file and are written to memory, so textures should automatically update if you change them. You might need to re-open the UI editor or use the refresh button to see them though.
- Support for text rotation
- Support for Font Effects, text should now look a lot more accurate (they can be laggy though so you can disable them in settings)
- Improved the loading times
- Some extra options, you can find them at Tools > Options > UI Editor Options
- Some bug fixes
